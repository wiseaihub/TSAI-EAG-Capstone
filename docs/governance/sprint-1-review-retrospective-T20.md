## Retrospective

### What Went Well
- All 20 primary + 3 sub-tasks completed within Sprint 1 timeline
- SAHI and BODH compliance mapped end-to-end in Week 1 (T02)
- Docs committed to structured `docs/` subfolders with consistent naming convention
- GitHub Project 8 board actively used to track progress and close issues
- Clear division of responsibilities: Sreedhar (governance/compliance/product/paper), Ritesh (architecture/infra/data)

### What to Improve
- Some deliverable docs were concise tables (stub level) — Sprint 2 docs should include fuller narrative content where needed
- `docs/paper/` folder creation was deferred to end of sprint — paper subfolder should be created at project setup
- Issue descriptions were added retrospectively — Sprint 2 issues should have descriptions at creation time

### Action Items for Sprint 2

| Action | Owner | Due |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Add narrative depth to compliance docs (T10, T11, T15) where evaluators require it | wiseaihub | Week 2, Day 1 |
| Create `docs/testing/` subfolder structure for Sprint 2 test artefacts | riteshverma | Week 2, Day 1 |
| Add Sprint 2 issue descriptions at point of creation | both | Ongoing |
| Begin arXiv Section 2 (Architecture) draft in parallel with build | wiseaihub | Week 2 |
